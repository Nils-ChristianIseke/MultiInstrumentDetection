  - chown it afterwards with your 'normal' user --> replace %USERID% with your local userid  
>  sudo mkdir /mnt/sds-stud  
  sudo chown -R %USERID% /mnt/sds-stud

Map the sds to this created folder  
> sshfs -o reconnect hd_qz262@lsdf02-sshfs.urz.uni-heidelberg.de:/sd22a004 /mnt/sds-stud -o idmap=user -o uid=\$(id -u) -o gid=$(id -g)

- load miniconda modules and the  cuda modules available by clicking on the hexagon icon on the left panel
- Open a terminal from Jupyter. This can be done by clicking the + button from the top left and selecting Terminal, and then type the following commands:


> conda create --name wft_endo  
conda activate wft_endo  
pip install -r /mnt/sds-hd/sd22a004/guest/setup/requirements.txt  
pip install ipykernel  
python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name=wft_endo  

- hint: if 'conda activate wft_endo' doesn't work, try 'source activate wft_endo' !
- try to run the cells in endo_data_quickstart and pytorch_quickstart notebooks
- once successful, please go back to the job tab and cancel the job to free up the resource for other users
